  <p>My name is Torrance J Davenport. I'm a programmer with a fondness for Javascript. Sometimes I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVElheX7KKedvQ2xcXwmlNA">record myself</a> building things. Rarely I'll <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tjdavenport2/?hl=en">take pictures</a> and post them online. I enjoy <a href="/js-mentoring">sharing my understanding</a> with people.</p>
  <p>I believe over-engineering costs more than copy/pasta. I believe abstractions are expensive and should only be introduced when a programmer's understanding of a problem reveals good design. I believe a good programmer thrives in complexity and avoids creating complexity of their own.</p>
